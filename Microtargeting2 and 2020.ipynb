    "What is the discourse of Twitter about microtargeting and the 2020 U.S. presidential election? \n",
    "\n",
    "The background to this question is that micro-targeting during the 2016 presidential campaign increased the likelihood for Republicans, especially those without a college degree (Donald Trump’s core supporters), to vote by 5-10 percent (Liberini et al. 2018, 5). In other words, micro-targeting might have helped Donald Trump win the election, which is further reflected in the fact that the Trump campaign spent 47 percent of its budget on digital media, compared to the Clinton’s campaign’s 8 percent (Liberini et al. 2018, 2). Liberini expresses this to be “further evidence that recent political outcomes, such as Brexit and the election of President Trump, might be largely due to the use of data analytics” (Kiggins 2018).\n",
